    bio: `I’m Imtiaj Iqbal Mahfuj, an undergraduate student of Urban and Regional Planning at Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology (RUET), driven by a strong passion for Geographic Information Systems (GIS), Remote Sensing, Google Earth Engine (GEE), and Geospatial Data Science with Python and Machine Learning. My academic and professional journey is centered on leveraging spatial data and advanced analytical techniques to design resilient, efficient, and sustainable urban environments. My interest lies at the intersection of spatial data and real-world impact, exploring how geospatial intelligence can inform better decision-making in areas like urban planning, disaster risk reduction, environmental management, and transportation systems. My expertise is further strengthened by specializations and certifications from leading institutions and top universities, including IBM, Google, the University of Michigan, and others. As a dedicated research enthusiast, I actively seek opportunities to dive deep into complex issues and produce actionable insights. My works have been featured in international conferences such as ICERIE, ICURP and presented at events organized by the Bangladesh Institute of Planners (BIP). I believe research isn’t just about publication—it’s about solving problems, informing policy, and bridging the gap between data and people. If you’re passionate about spatial data, planning for resilient futures, or collaborating on research-driven projects, feel free to reach out. Let’s connect and create something impactful together.`
